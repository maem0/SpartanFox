# How to install

Find your profile folder, by typing about:support in the address bar, look for the Profile Folder line and click on Open Folder, once its open, in there paste the "chrome" folder from the downloaded zip file in there.

# What doesn't work
 Anything Linux/MacOS related, I didn't test outside of Firefox 133, and what's implemented is just a basic design for tabs and icons, I'll add the side menu for downloads, bookmarks, history and etc next update probably. but there's alot more missing.
